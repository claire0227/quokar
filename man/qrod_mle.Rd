\title{Outlier Dignostic for Quantile Regression with Asymmetric Laplace Distribution}
\usage{
qrod_mle(y, x, tau, error, iter, method = c("cook.distance", "qfunction"))
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Dependent variable in quantile regression}

\item{x}{Indepdent variables in quantile regression.
Note that: x is the independent variable matrix which including
the intercept. That means, if the dimension of independent
variables is p and the sample size is n, x is a n times p+1
matrix with the first column is one.}

\item{tau}{quantile}

\item{error}{The EM algorithm accuracy of error used in MLE estimation}

\item{iter}{the iteration frequancy for EM algorithm used in MLE estimation}

\item{method}{the diagnostic method for outlier detection}
}
\description{
This function cacluate the generalized cook distance and q function distance
of quantile regression model with asymmetric laplace distribution.

\details{
Case-deletion is a classical approach to study the effects of dropping the
\eqn{i}th case from the data set. Thus, the complete-data log-likelihhod
function based on the data with \eqn{i}th cse deleted with be denoted by
\eqn{l_{c}(\theta|y_{c(i)})}. Let \eqn{\hat{\theta_{p(i)}} = (\hat{\beta^{'}_{p(i)}},
\hat{\sigma^{2}}_{(i)})^{'}} be the maximizer of the function

\deqn{Q_{(i)}(\theta|\hat{\theta})=E_{\hat{\theta}}[l_{c}(\theta|Y_{c(i)})|y]}

To assess the influence of the \eqn{i}th case on the EM estimate \eqn{\hat{\theta}},
we compare \eqn{\hat{\theta_(i)}} and \eqn{\hat{\theta}}, and if \eqn{\hat{\theta_(i)}}
is far from \eqn{\hat{\theta_(i)}} in some sense, then the \eqn{i}th case is regarded
as influential. Based on the metric for measuring the distance between \eqn{\hat{\theta_(i)}}
and \eqn{\hat{\theta}} proposed by Zhu et al.(2001), we consider here the following
generalized Cook distance:

\deqn{GD_{i} = (\hat{\theta_{(i)}}-\hat{\theta{i}})^{'}
{-Q(\hat{\theta}|\hat{\theta})}
(\hat{\theta_{(i)}}-\hat{\theta{i}})}

Another measure of the influence of the \eqn{i}th case is the
following Q-distance
function, similar to the likelihood distance \eqn{LD_{i}}
(Cook and Weisberg, 1982),
defined as

\deqn{QD_{i} = 2{Q(\hat{\theta}|\hat{\theta})-Q(\hat{\theta_{(i)}})}}
